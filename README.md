🧮 Web Calculator

A simple and responsive web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project helped me understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic JavaScript logic.

🚀 Features

Basic arithmetic operations:
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖ Multiplication
➗ Division

Responsive calculator UI

Interactive button clicks

Clear button to reset the screen

Error handling for invalid expressions

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure of the calculator

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Logic and interactivity

 ┗ 📜 README.md

🧠 How It Works

Each calculator button is an <li> element.

JavaScript adds click event listeners to all buttons.

Numbers and operators are displayed on the screen.

The eval() function evaluates the mathematical expression.

The Clear button resets the calculator screen.

▶️ How to Run Locally

⚠️ Known Limitations

Uses JavaScript eval() (not recommended for large/secure apps)

No keyboard input support yet

No backspace button

🔮 Future Improvements

Add keyboard support

Implement backspace/delete functionality

Replace eval() with a safer calculation logic

Improve mobile responsiveness

Add dark/light mode
